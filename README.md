Car Share database project

A Car share database project was created using SQL. 

First, we created all the tables such as: user, car, driver, availability, reservation, and trip. After, my group and I used the faker module to populate at least 500 users. We added diesel and gasoline fuel types in the car table, designed some users as drivers and provided their license information. After we defined some functions such as: get_available_cars that returns the list of cars available for rental and not already reserved. Reserve_cars that creates a reservation with a start and end date and much more. 

Finally, we ran some queries to test our database such as: 
list all drivers who have reserved a car between Christmas and New Years, pick one car and show all the drivers who have rented it, list all drivers who have rented a car before they turned 25 years old, list all male drivers aged 65 and over and more.
